# DEEP LEARNING PROJECTS

The files are made by ANN & CNN method. This notebook files are made for classify different kind of topics such as breast cancer,
animal detection, digit classification and many others. Those files can be used in daily files by people to detect things from images. Using images they can train and test Neural network models easily.


## Appendix

It's a part of Deep learning and Neural Network, For Using this project it must need camera, images and high performance computer
